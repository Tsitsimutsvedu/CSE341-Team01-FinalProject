HTTP DELETE – Happiness Ncube

I will implement the DELETE routes for the API.

* For each collection (products, stores, employees, and users), I will write secure DELETE endpoints that check for proper authentication and authorization before removing records from the MongoDB database.
* I will also include error handling to ensure that attempts to delete non-existent or protected records return clear, meaningful responses.
* These routes will be thoroughly tested to confirm that only authorized admin or employee accounts can perform deletions.


 API Swagger Documentation for all API routes – Happiness Ncube

I will create and maintain the Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation for every API endpoint at the `/api-docs` route.

* This includes writing detailed specifications for request parameters, request bodies, authentication requirements, and expected responses.
* The documentation will clearly mark which endpoints are protected by OAuth and require authentication.
* This will make it easy for teammates, testers, and future developers to explore and understand how to use our Simple Marketplace API.

I hope it all makes sense.
